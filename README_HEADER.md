The `dbsched` bundle is preconfigured with the Pado scheduler to periodically execute jobs that dump database tables to CSV files from which it automatically extracts column information to generate the corresponding `VersionedPortable` classes. It then transforms the CSV records to objects using the generated classes before ingesting them into Hazelcast.
